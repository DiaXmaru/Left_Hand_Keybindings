# One Handed Typing

 This script helps with typing using only your left hand and the **side mouse key**. It uses autohotkey.

# Key Changes


|  |Original     |Modified  |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Row 0|`'12345'`|`'67890'`|
|Row 1|`'qwert'`|`'yuiop'`|
|Row 2|`'asdfg'`|`'hjkl;'`|
|Row 3|`'zxcvb'`|`'nm,.?'`|
||`'Tab'`|`'Enter'`|
||`'Glave'`|`'Backspace'`|

## To Do List

Need a Way to use Shift and keep all functionality. At the moment, there if you press shift you lose the key. Mouse 4 plus shift plus q will be Q when it should be  Y but that probably just means I need to put that into ahk directly
